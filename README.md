A Symfony project created on February 12, 2017, 9:04 am.

### Interest for me

1.- Start server: php app/console server:run

2.- Download repository and install in other machine

* Clone repository and execute 'sudo composer install' (First asign read/write permissions)

### Errors and solutions

1.- Warning: date_default_timezone_get() installing Symfony

`[Symfony\Component\Debug\Exception\ContextErrorException]                                     Warning: date_default_timezone_get(): It is not safe to rely on the system's timezone settings.
You are *required* to use the date.timezone setting or the date_default_timezone_set() function.
In case you used any of those methods and you are still getting this warning, you most likely
misspelled the timezone identifier. We selected the timezone 'UTC' for now, but please set
date.timezone to select your timezone. in `
